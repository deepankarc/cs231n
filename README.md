### Assignment - 1 
* [x] K-Nearest Neighbours
* [x] Support Vector Machines
* [x] Softmax
* [x] Two-Layer Neural Network ~~(TODO: slight changes to calculation of deltas in backprop for softmax layer)~~
* [x] Features

### Assignment - 2
* [x] Fully-connected Nets
* [x] Batchnormalisation
* [x] Dropout
* [x] Convolutional Neural Network ~~(TODO: Improve classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 above 65%)~~
* [x] Implement parametric ReLU
